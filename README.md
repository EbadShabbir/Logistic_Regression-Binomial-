# Logistic Regression on Social Network Ads Dataset

This project implements a **Logistic Regression** model using the Social Network Ads dataset to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary. The model is trained and tested on a split of the dataset, and its performance is visualized with confusion matrices and decision boundary plots for both the training and test sets.

## Overview
This project demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing the data.
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
- Applying **feature scaling** to normalize the features.
- Training a **Logistic Regression** model.
- Visualizing decision boundaries for both the training and test sets.

## Dataset
The dataset is the Social Network Ads dataset, which includes the following columns:
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Gender**: Gender of the user.
- **Age**: Age of the user.
- **Estimated Salary**: Estimated salary of the user.
- **Purchased**: Whether the user purchased the product (0 or 1).

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Social Network Ads](https://www.kaggle.com).
